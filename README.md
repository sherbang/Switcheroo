Switcheroo (gitpod edition)
===========================

I've modified Switcheroo to take redirect commands from headers from gitpod workspaces.  This is meant to be used in conjunction with my [gp_browser command](https://gitlab.com/sherbang/gitpod-utils).

[Chrome redirects extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/switcheroo-redirector/cnmciclhnghalnpfhhleggldniplelbg?hl=en).
